# 7. The Warshall algorithm is very similar to the Floyd algorithm, but in this case we do not want to know the shortest path but only if there is a path. Write the algorithm modifying as appropriate the Floyd algorithm. The adjacency matrix is of bool type.

```
Floyd(g:Vector[1..n][1..n]of R) ret p:Vector[1..n][1..n]of Bool
    for k <- 1 to n
        for i <- 1 to n
            for j <- 1 to n
                p[i,j] <- (g[i,j] || g[i,k] && g[k,j]);
            endf
        endf
    endf
```
