# 9. Given a sequence X=<x1, x2, ..., xn> we say a sequence Z=< z1, z2, ..., zk> is a subsequence of X if there exists a strictly increasing sequence < i 1, i 2, ..., i k> of indices of X such that for all j=1,2,...,k, we have xij=zj. For example, Z=<B,C,D,B> is a subsequence of X=<A,B,C,B,D,A,B> with corresponding index sequence <2,3,5,7>. Given two sequences X and Y, we say that a sequence Z is a common subsequence of X and Y if Z is a subsequence of both X and Y. We want to obtain the longest common subsequence (LCS) of two sequences. We define L(i,j) as the length of a longest common subsequence of the sequences X i and Yj, where X i and Yj are prefixes of X and Y (X i=<x 1, x 2, ..., x i> and Yj=<y1, y2, ..., yj>). A recursive solution to this problem can be the following.

## a) Write an algorithm for calculating the LCS of 2 strings (only the length).

```
LCS(X, Y: string) ret L: Vector[0..m][0..n] of Nat
    for i <- 0 to length(X)
        L[i][0] <- 0
    endf

    for j <- 1 to length(Y)
        L[0][j] <- 0
    endf

    for i <- 1 to lenght(X)
        for j <- 1 to lenght(Y)
            if (X[i] == Y[j])
                L[i][j] <- L[i-1][j-1]+1
            else 
                L[i][j] <- max(L[i-1][j], L[i][j-1])
            endif

```

## b) Modify the previous algorithm for calculating also the sequence itself. The algorithm will return a matrix of char representing the direction followed by the algorithm inside the matrix for obtaining the values: D – diagonal, L – left, U – up. Write a function for printing the sequence using the matrix step.

```
LCS2(X, Y: string) ret L: Vector[0..m][0..n] of Nat; step: Vector[1..m][1..n] of char
    for i <- 0 to length(X)
        L[i][0] <- 0
    endf

    for j <- 1 to length(Y)
        L[0][j] <- 0
    endf

    for i <- 1 to lenght(X)
        for j <- 1 to lenght(Y)
            if (X[i] == Y[j])
                L[i][j] <- L[i-1][j-1]+1
                step[i][j] <- 'D'
            else 
                if (L[i-1][j] >= L[i][j-1])
                    L[i][j] <- L[i-1][j]
                    step[i][j] <- 'I'
                else
                    L[i][j] <- L[i][j-1]
                    step[i][j] <- 'A'
                endif
            endif

printStep(step: Vector[1..m][1..n], X: string) ret: void
    Aux: stack

    while (i > 0 or j > 0)
        if (step[i][j] == 'D')
            Aux.append(X[i]);
            j <- j-1
            i <- i-1
        endif

        if (step[i][j] == 'A')
            j <- j-1
        endif

        if (step[i][j] == 'I')
            i <- i-1
        endif
    endw

    for the number of elements of Aux
        print(top(Aux))
    endf
```
