# 10. We want to calculate the matrix (M) which is a chained matrix multiplication of n matrices: M = M1 M2 ...Mn, but minimizing the total number of scalar multiplications. Remember that matrix multiplication is associative but not commutative, so we can choose which multiplications we want to do first, but we cannot change the order of the matrices. Suppose Mi is of dimension d i-1xd i and so the M iM i+1 multiplication requires a total of d i-1d id i+1 scalar operations. We define M(i,j) as the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed for the calculation of the chained matrix multiplication of MiM i+1...M j. Therefore, the solution to the problem is M(1,n). The recursive formula for M(i,j) can be defined as follows.

## a) From the previous formula, write a program for calculating M(1,n) with dynamic programming.

```
M(i, j: Nat) ret x: Nat
    m : Vector[1..n][1..n]

    for l <- 1 to n
        m[l][l] <- 0
    endf

    for k <- i to j
        if (m[i][k] + m[k+1][j] + d[i-1] * d[k] * d[j] < m[i][j])
            m[i][j] <- m[i][k] + m[k+1][j] + d[i-1] * d[k] * d[j]
        endif
    endf

    x <- m[i][j]
```
